          I learned in NEYCFLS from Grade 7 to Grade 11 in China. It provides me with firm knowledge basis in many subjects and fields. Teachers there discovered and motivated my interest in Computer Science.

          I also spent time participating in many school activities. During Grade 10 and 11, I worked in Student Union in the *Department of publicity*, in responsible for *photographing* and *social media operation*
